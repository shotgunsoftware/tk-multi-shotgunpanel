        actions menu.

        The mapping between Shotgun objects and actions are kept in a different place
        (in the configuration) so at the point when this hook is called, the app
        has already established *which* actions are appropriate for this object.

        This method needs to return detailed data for those actions, in the form of a list
        of dictionaries, each with name, params, caption and description keys.

        The ui_area parameter is a string and indicates where the item is to be shown.

        - If it will be shown in the main browsing area, "main" is passed.
        - If it will be shown in the details area, "details" is passed.
