        API support to start the panel and navigate to a location.

        Depending on the mode parameter, the window behavior may
        differ, but the general idea is that if a panel window doesn't exist
        or isn't in focus, it is created and/or brought to front before navigating
        to the given entity. The new location is added to the existing history stack,
        allowing the user to easily move back again if needed and effectively undo
        the programmatic navigation.

        The following modes exist:
        - PANEL - launch the panel as a panel. Panels are always singleton, so this will start
          the panel if it doesn't already exist. If it exists it will be given user focus. Note that
          on engines without panel support implemented, this flag will be equivalent to DIALOG
          below.
        - DIALOG - launch the panel as a dialog. A dialog may co-exist with a panel. If a dialog
          already exists, it is given focus.
        - NEW_DIALOG - launch the panel as a dialog without attempting to reuse any
          existing dialogs that may have been created in previous calls.
